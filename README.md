### [LSPosed Repository](https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/com.varuns2002.disable_flag_secure)

## Requirements:

- Android 8.0+ (Oreo/SDK 26)

- Xposed implementation installed properly like [LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed/)
  and [EdXposed](https://github.com/ElderDrivers/EdXposed/)

- Untested but may work on Rootless Xposed implementations like [LSPatch](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPatch)
  and [Tai Chi](https://github.com/taichi-framework/TaiChi/)

## Usage:

- LSPosed:
    - Enable the module
    - Select `System Framework`
    - Select the target app in which you want to enable screenshots
    - Reboot
- EdXposed:
    - Normal Mode:
        - Enable the module and reboot
    - White List / Activation Scope Mode:
        - Enable the module
        - Select `Android System`
        - Select the target app in which you want to enable screenshots
        - Reboot
    - Black List Mode:
        - Enable the module
        - Do not select `Android System`
        - Do not select the target app in which you want to enable screenshots
        - Reboot

## Note:

- This app does not prevent apps from detecting that you've taken a screenshot or recorded it like Snap or Instagram.
  This only enables it in apps that prohibit screenshots and recording. So don't screenshot your girlfriend's nudes.
  (You probably don't have one since you're reading this anyway)

### Additional Information on DRM encrypted content

This is applicable only for some apps on some devices. If you aren't facing any issues, you can ignore these
instructions.

When playing DRM encrypted content, most devices will use hardware decryption capabilities. This hardware decryption
will push the video directly onto the screen, bypassing any screenshots/screenshare/recording functionality.

One possible solution is to disable this hardware decryption by installing the Magisk
module [`liboemcrypto.so disabler`](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/liboemcryptodisabler). This will force the
device to not use hardware decryption and in combination with this module will enable screenshots, screen sharing and
recording.

Installing this module might have unintended consequences, such as lowered video quality and a reduced Widevine security
level.
